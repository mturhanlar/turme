## Docker File Linter

A Dockerfile linter is a tool that checks your Dockerfile for errors and best practices. It can help you catch issues before you build your image and deploy it to production.

`dockerfilelinter -f Dockerfile`\


`dockerfilelint Dockerfile`\


`dockerlint -f Dockerfile`\
\
`hadolint Dockerfile`

and after that, it will give you the errors you need to fix based on the best practices.&#x20;
